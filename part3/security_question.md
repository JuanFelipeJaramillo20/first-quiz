# Security Considerations for Solar Panel Installation App

## Using OWASP Top 10 as a Guide

The following are security considerations for the solar panel installation app infrastructure, based on the OWASP Top 10 for 2021:

1. **Injection (A03):** Verify and secure the Python backend to prevent SQL injection and other forms of injection attacks.

2. **Broken Authentication (A02):** Implement secure authentication methods and password hashing in the mobile app and web frontend. Securely store sensitive data, such as passwords.

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure (A02):** Encrypt data in transit and at rest, and enforce proper access controls to protect customer data.

4. **XML External Entity (XXE) (A06):** Ensure that XML inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent XXE vulnerabilities in the Python backend.

5. **Security Misconfigurations (A05):** Regularly review Kubernetes container configurations and apply security best practices. Keep all components up-to-date.

6. **Broken Access Control (A01):** Enforce proper access control policies and implement role-based access control to limit access to customer data.

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (A03):** Sanitize user inputs and implement security headers to prevent XSS attacks in the web frontend.

8. **Insecure Deserialization (A08):** Safely and securely handle deserialization in the Python backend and avoid components with insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (A06):** Regularly scan and update dependencies and libraries to address known vulnerabilities.

10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (A09):** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring, and set up alerts for unusual activities.

11. **Broken Function-Level Authorization (A01):** Enforce proper authorization checks at the function level in the Python backend.

12. **API Security:** Secure APIs with tokens, rate limiting, and authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

13. **Data Validation:** Implement input validation to reject invalid or malicious data.

14. **Third-Party Integration Security:** Review the security of third-party services and integrations.

15. **Employee Access:** Limit employee access, enforce strong authentication, and regularly review access rights.
